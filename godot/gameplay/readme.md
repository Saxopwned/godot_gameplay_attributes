You can find two folders:
	
- attributes, for attributes
- buffs		, for attributes buffs

each directory contains another one

- scripts, 		for attributes definitions
- resources, 	instances of the scripts

the reason of scripts instances, is because they perform better (since are unique at runtime),
so it's always a better choice if possible (and if it is reasonable).
