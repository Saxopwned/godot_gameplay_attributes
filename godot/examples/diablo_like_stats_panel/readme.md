I love Diablo and similar games.

This example shows how to handle a lot (and I mean a lot) of base and derived 
attributes.

There's also a panel to boost some of those, so you can see the stats increase or decrease.

The concept behind this example is the same as the `attributes_initialization` one, but with
direct control over the values and with more and more attributes running.
